## Atmospheric Dispersion Module in Python

This directory contains the Python implementation of the Atmospheric Dispersion Module - (*atm_dispersion.py*).

The module makes use of scipy, matplotlib, and AstroPy. The solar coordinates are calculated using the ERFA package in AstroPy.

The Dispersion_examples.ipynb notebook gives several examples of how to use the module and what the inputs are.

The IDL code was originally developed for the publication:<BR>
Reardon, K.P., 2006, "The Effects of Atmospheric Dispersion on High-Resolution Solar Spectroscopy", Solar Physics, 239, pp. 503-517.
https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006SoPh..239..503R/abstract<BR>
Please cite this work when using this code.

The Python code is derived from the IDL code, thanks to work by Katie Lee and Ryan Hofmann.
