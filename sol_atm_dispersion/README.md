### Atmospheric Dispersion Module in Python

This directory contains the Python implementation of the Atmospheric Dispersion Module - (*atm_dispersion.py*).

The module makes use of scipy, matplotlib, and AstroPy. The solar coordinates are calculated using the ERFA package in AstroPy.

The Dispersion_examples.ipynb notebook gives several examples of how to use the module and what the inputs are.

This Python implementation was the work of Katie Lee and Ryan Hofmann.
